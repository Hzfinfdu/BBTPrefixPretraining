# MPMP

## Installation
python 3.7 is recommended.
```bash
pip install transformers==4.11.3
pip install datasets
pip install cma
pip install fastNLP
pip install sklearn
pip install bayesian-optimization
pip install scipy

## Training

## Notes
Datasets are coming soon :)

Our main contribution and implementation details are included in the current public version. While we need to make some modification to our dataset loading scripts and upload them to Google Drive for reproduction. This may take a few days.

After that we will add more information and illustration on our method to this repo.
